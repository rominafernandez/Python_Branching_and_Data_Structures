## Exercise 8 - Creating lists

# Write a Program that creates at least four different lists.
# Two of them should contain only strings and two of them should contain only numbers.
# Try to generate a list that mixes strings and numbers.
# Does this work?.

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
list2 = [1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7]
list3 = ["I", "am", "a", "list", "of", "strings"]
list4 = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
list5 = [1, 5, "Hello", "World", 5.5, 6.6]

print(list1)
print(list2)
print(list3)
print(list4)
print(list5)
