## Group Exercise 2 - Options Menu

# Write a program that takes at least 6 different numbers as input from the user.
# Then ask the user which of the four standard mathematical operations the program should run over these numbers.
# Use Print commands to show the user what options he has.
# Create an if-statement that checks what option the user chose (use if elif else).
# donâ€™t forget to include a security check.
# Run your mathematical operations inside this statement.
# Print out the results by using f-strings or commas.
